## react.three60five.common

Welcome to the portfolio site of David Allen coded as a simple Single Page Application using React and React-Router. I created this version of the portfolio after I coded it using static html and css. I wanted to learn the basics of React and experiment with turning html+css patterns into react components.

I started with the create-react-app npm package and set out to refactor three60five.com. Both three60five.com and react.three60five.com rely heavily on Tachyons, a composable css framework for rapid prototyping. I've tried to use the most up to date ES6 syntax. The code patterns were well documented and made sense to me.

This is my first react project and I really had a lot of fun learning and using the library.
