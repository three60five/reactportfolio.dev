## react.three60five.common

Welcome to the portfolio site of David Allen coded as a simple Single Page Application using React and React-Router. I created this version of the portfolio after I coded it using static html and css. I wanted to learn the basics of React and experiment with turning html+css patterns into react components.

Both three60five.com and react.three60five.com rely heavily on Tachyons, a composable css framework for rapid prototyping.

This is my first react project and I really had a lot of fun learning and using the library.
